# Dyadic-Affect-Networks
Hello! This GitHub page is associated with the paper "Variation in emotion dynamics over time is associated with future relationship outcomes" by Simran K. Johal and Emilio Ferrer.

To view the GIFs showing changes in dynamic parameters for each dyad over time, please navigate to the "Dyad Networks" folder. In each gif, red lines represent negative relations and blue lines represent positive relations between variables. Line thickness corresponds to the strength of that relation.

The GIFs in the "Dyad Plots" folder shows the change in all parameters over time on a coordinate plot, with the x-axis representing time and y-axis representing the value of the dynamic parameter.
